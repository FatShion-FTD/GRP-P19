GUI programming and face recognition/identification with Python.

core functionality {
	recognize and identify the faces of the students enrolled in a specific module.
	recording time of arrival of the students given the time schedule once the face of the student is identified.
	statistical data such as how many students have attended for the current session and who are missing.
	how many classes are missed by a specific student.
	// addition
	student information database{
		Face 
		Student id
	}
	management log in, set lecture time, search data from particular lecture or student.
	adminstrator log in, set parameter to adjust accuracy.
}

tasks {
	1) overall system design;
	2) face recognition design and development, data related function design and development;
	3) GUI design and development;
	4) testing at different levels

	use case diagram{
		// need to be more detailed
		change 'view' to 'search'
		change 'face info' to 'image'
		change 'modify' to 'add / delete / update'
	}

		use water-fall model process
		first design, then develop
	}
	four parts{
		//develop seperate parts and then integrate 
		UI, DB, camera based and DB based
	}
